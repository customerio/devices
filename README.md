# @customerio/devices

Utility to map device models to marketing friendly device name. The android list is pretty huge, and we've decided to cater to the most popular brands based on [market share](https://www.appbrain.com/stats/top-manufacturers). If you need a device that isn't in the list, please open an issue or a PR.

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save @customerio/devices
```

## Usage

```ts
import { getMarketingName, OsType } from '@customerio/devices';

console.log(getMarketingName('iPhone14,2', OsType.IOS));
```
Output:

```bash
iPhone 13 Pro
```
